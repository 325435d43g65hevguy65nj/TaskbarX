# FalconX
FalconX is a tool written in VB.NET that centers your taskbar icons with animations.

FalconX uses the UIAutomation API (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/ui-automation/ui-automation-overview)
to get the width of your taskbar and uses SetWindowPos(https://www.pinvoke.net/default.aspx/user32.setwindowpos) to move the taskbar.

It uses Dot Net Transitions (https://github.com/UweKeim/dot-net-transitions) for the animations.
